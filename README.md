# CODE-QUIZ

## Description
Interactive website that will test knowledge on javascript by continiously asking multiple choice questions. Try to answer as many questions correfctly as you can in 1 minute! Don't rush though, as each wrong answer makes you lose 10 second. Compete with others or yourself with a local storage leaderboard system that allows you to leave your initials and score.

## Learned Information
Learned a lot about local storage and how to work with it. Also dom manipulation and how to get references to different elements on a page, how to dynamically create them and how to set attributes. Event listeners. Figured out JSON and how to use objects to make code more managable and simpler. Intervals and timeouts and how they can make website interactive. Insertion sort and array manipulation. This project was a nice introduction to javascript and really taught quite a bit!
